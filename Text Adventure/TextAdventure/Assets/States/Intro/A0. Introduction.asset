  storyText: "You are an interstellar explorer. Ten years ago you departed your home
    planet of Mars to explore the universe, finding new places to start colonies.
    You've had lots of interesting adventures, but none as crazy as this one.\n\nOne
    day, as you neared the Omega-Centauri solar system, an alarm began to blare from
    the center console. All of your major functions have failed, beyond repair! \n\n\"I'm
    going to die here\" you think to yourself, as you use point your ship to the third
    planet from the sun. Your momentum carries you to the outer edge of the planet's
    atmosphere as you begin your entry. Thankfully, most of your re-entry systems
    are still functional and you crash land rather gracefully, but your ship is toast.
    You get out and look around..\n\nAt each stage of this story, you'll be asked
    to push key 1 or 2 based on your choice of progression.\n\nAt any time, push \"q\"
    to quit."
