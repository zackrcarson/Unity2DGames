  storyText: "Behind you lies your destroyed starship, hot flames warming your back
    as thick, black smoke floats up overhead. \r\nIn front of you lies a vast, alien
    wasteland. Nothing but blue rock in every direction all the way to the horizon.\r\nYou
    see a few scattered blue rocks to your right, and you swear you can hear a faint
    scittering underneath the ground ahead of you.\r\n\nWhat should I do?\r\n1. Investigate
    the rocks.\r\n2. Investigate the undeerground noises."
