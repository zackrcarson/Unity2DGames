  storyText: 'You found a great spot to start a new life! There is water, plentiful
    food growing and alien animals running around, and minerals to mine. You gather
    enough materials to fix your ship, repair it, send out communications for others
    to join you, and begin your new life on this strange planet. What else could be
    hiding out there for you to find?


    Press either 1 or 2 to start over.'
